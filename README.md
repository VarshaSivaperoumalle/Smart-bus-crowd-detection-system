# Smart Bus Crowd Detection System

An AI-powered real-time crowd monitoring system for buses using YOLO-based object detection, camera feed processing, and automated occupancy analysis. This project helps ensure safety, crowd management, and operational efficiency in public transport systems.

## Project Overview

The Smart Bus Crowd Detection System captures live video from onboard cameras, detects passengers, counts occupancy, and sends updates to a backend/server or Firebase. It is designed for:

- Preventing overcrowding  
- Real-time monitoring by transport authorities  
- Automated passenger count analytics  
- Safety and surveillance
